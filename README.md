# YepCode Run

A powerful serverless runtime and SDK for executing code in secure sandboxes, with a complete platform for building, managing, and monitoring your script executions.

Built on top of [YepCode Cloud](https://yepcode.io/), the enterprise platform that enables seamless script execution for AI agents, data processing, API integrations, and automation workflows.

## Try it Now

- Test code execution in real-time
- Experiment with different languages and packages
- Learn through hands-on examples

## Why YepCode Run?

Running arbitrary code in production environments presents significant challenges around security, scalability, and infrastructure management. This is especially critical when dealing with **AI-generated code** from LLMs, where code execution needs to be both secure and reliable at scale and may also need to install external dependencies.

YepCode Run eliminates these complexities by providing enterprise-grade sandboxing, automatic scaling, and comprehensive security measures out of the box - allowing you to focus on your code instead of infrastructure concerns.

## 🚀 Features

- 🚀 **Instant Code Execution** - Run JavaScript and Python code in secure sandboxes without any setup
- 🔒 **Enterprise-Ready Platform** - Full suite of tools for building, deploying and monitoring processes
- 🔄 **Built for Integration** - Perfect for AI agents, data processing, API integrations and automation workflows
- 📊 **Complete Observability** - Monitor executions, manage credentials, and audit changes in one place
- 🛠️ **Developer Experience** - Write code in our web IDE or use our API/SDK to integrate with your apps
- 📦 **Package Freedom** - Use any external dependency with automatic package detection or specify exact versions using `@add-package` annotations

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install yepcode_run
```

## 🔑 Get your YepCode API token

You can get your YepCode API token from the [YepCode Cloud](https://cloud.yepcode.io) platform under `Settings` > `API credentials`.

This token may be provided to the `YepCodeRun`, `YepCodeEnv` or `YepCodeApi` constructor, or set in the `YEPCODE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

```env
YEPCODE_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

## 💻 Usage

### ⚡ Code Execution

The `YepCodeRun` class provides flexible code execution capabilities:

```python
from yepcode_run import YepCodeRun, YepCodeApiConfig

runner = YepCodeRun(
    YepCodeApiConfig(api_token='your-api-token')  # We'll try to read it from the YEPCODE_API_TOKEN environment variable
)

# Execute code with full options
execution = runner.run(
    """def main():
    message = "Hello, YepCode!"
    print(message)
    return {"message": message}""",
    {
        "language": "python",  # Optional - auto-detected if not specified
        "onLog": lambda log: print(f"{log.timestamp} {log.level}: {log.message}"),
        "onFinish": lambda return_value: print("Finished:", return_value),
        "onError": lambda error: print("Error:", error)
    }
)

# Wait for execution to complete
execution.wait_for_done()

# Retrieve an existing execution
existing_execution = runner.get_execution('execution-id')
```

### 🔐 Environment Variables

You may use environment variables in your code with `process.env` (JavaScript) or `os.getenv` (Python), and you may manage this environment variables in the YepCode platform ([docs here](https://yepcode.io/docs/processes/team-variables)), or using this `YepCodeEnv` class:

```python
from yepcode_run import YepCodeEnv, YepCodeApiConfig

env = YepCodeEnv(
    YepCodeApiConfig(api_token='your-api-token')
)

# Set environment variables
env.set_env_var('API_KEY', 'secret-value')           # Sensitive by default
env.set_env_var('DEBUG', 'true', False)             # Non-sensitive variable

# Get all environment variables
variables = env.get_env_vars()
# Returns: [TeamVariable(key='API_KEY', value='secret-value'), TeamVariable(key='DEBUG', value='true')]

# Delete an environment variable
env.del_env_var('API_KEY')
```

### 🌐 Direct API access

You can also directly access the full [YepCode API](https://yepcode.io/docs/api) using the `YepCodeApi` class:

```python
from yepcode_run import YepCodeApi, YepCodeApiConfig

api = YepCodeApi(
  YepCodeApiConfig(api_token='your-api-token')
)

# Get all processes
processes = api.get_processes()
```
